R code to analyze Divvy data


First, download the Divvy data you want to load : https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data
  Right now only 2017 is supported
Second, download this repository as a .zip file
  It includes the R code and the Chicago weather
Third, update the function calls on line 27 and 28 to the location where you downloaded the data
  I've been using C:/Divvy/
Fourth, run it!
